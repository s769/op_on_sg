# Sobolev Orthogonal Polynomials on the Sierpinski Gasket

This repository primarily contains python code used to construct, analyze, and visualize Sobolev Orthogonal Polynomials on the Sierpinski Gasket. This code is largely used in our SPUR project https://e.math.cornell.edu/sites/op_on_sg/.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The following python libraries (in addition to the standard library) are required to use this package:

* numpy
* scipy
* sympy
* gmpy2
* tqdm



### Usage

The ops_main.py file contains the code used to generate the orthogonal polynomials. The monomials.py file and plotting.py
file can be used to plot the polynomials on SG.

  abstract = {The construction of a Laplacian on a class of fractals which includes the Sierpinski gasket (SG) has given rise to intensive research on analysis on fractals. For instance, a complete theory of polynomials and power series on SG has been developed by one of us and his coauthors. We build on this body of work to construct certain analogs of classical orthogonal polynomials (OP) on SG. In particular, we investigate key properties of these OP on SG, including a three-term recursion formula and the asymptotics of the coefficients appearing in this recursion. Moreover, we develop numerical tools that allow us to graph a number of these OP. Finally, we use these numerical tools to investigate the structure of the zero and the nodal sets of these polynomials.},

  abstract = {We study the analog of power series expansions on the Sierpinski gasket, for analysis based on the Kigami Laplacian. The analog of polynomials are multiharmonic functions, which have previously been studied in connection with Taylor approximations and splines. Here the main technical result is an estimate of the size of the monomials analogous to xn/n!. We propose a definition of entire analytic functions as functions represented by power series whose coefficients satisfy exponential growth conditions that are stronger than what is required to guarantee uniform convergence. We present a characterization of these functions in terms of exponential growth conditions on powers of the Laplacian of the function. These entire analytic functions enjoy properties, such as rearrangement and unique determination by infinite jets, that one would expect. However, not all exponential functions (eigenfunctions of the Laplacian) are entire analytic, and also many other natural candidates, such as the heat kernel, do not belong to this class. Nevertheless, we are able to use spectral decimation to study exponentials, and in particular to create exponentially decaying functions for negative eigenvalues.},

  abstract      = {<p><em>Differential Equations on Fractals</em>opens the door to understanding the recently developed area of analysis on fractals, focusing on the construction of a Laplacian on the Sierpinski gasket and related fractals. Written in a lively and informal style, with lots of intriguing exercises on all levels of difficulty, the book is accessible to advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and mathematicians who seek an understanding of analysis on fractals. Robert Strichartz takes the reader to the frontiers of research, starting with carefully motivated examples and constructions.</p><p>One of the great accomplishments of geometric analysis in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the development of the theory of Laplacians on smooth manifolds. But what happens when the underlying space is rough? Fractals provide models of rough spaces that nevertheless have a strong structure, specifically self-similarity. Exploiting this structure, researchers in probability theory in the 1980s were able to prove the existence of Brownian motion, and therefore of a Laplacian, on certain fractals. An explicit analytic construction was provided in 1989 by Jun Kigami.<em>Differential Equations on Fractals</em>explains Kigami's construction, shows why it is natural and important, and unfolds many of the interesting consequences that have recently been discovered.</p><p>This book can be used as a self-study guide for students interested in fractal analysis, or as a textbook for a special topics course.</p>},
